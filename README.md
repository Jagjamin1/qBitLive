Just a little test project I made to practice my programming.
Idea from armeliens.

When run will show (for now) total size of all qBittorrent torrents, total size of remaining to download, average speed, average ETA of torrents actively downloading. Updates every second.
Subject to change. Please submit feature requests

Has option to enter username, password, IP Address, and port, otherwise defaults to the following:
UN:admin PW:adminadmin IP:localhost Port:8080
